For this version there's only one enemy, a zombie dog that runs and pseudo-randomly jumps attacking

It's capable of tracking and store the player best score and also it's possible to reset the best score to 0

# Improve possibilities

Rewrite the code applying the Clean Code concepts

Implements project patterns (observers, message protocol, etc)
